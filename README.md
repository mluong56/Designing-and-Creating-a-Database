This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a Business Intelligence solution tailored for a small private education organization interested in Student Enrollments. Built using Microsoft SQL Server, the solution includes an OLTP source database from Azure Cloud, a deployed data warehouse, ETL processes, and a deployed SSAS Tabular Model to demonstrate the solution. Deliverables include reporting, a star-schema data warehouse, and interactive dashboards developed in Excel. The project emphasizes end-to-end BI development, from data modeling to ETL scripting, and tabular data modeling showcasing the lifecycle of database development. Through this process, the school is given the visibility into enrollment trends, class capacities, and student activity, enabling better decision-making, and more effective resource planning.

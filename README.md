# Analyzing Student Enrollment Trends 

## Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a Business Intelligence solution tailored for a small private education organization interested in Student Enrollments. Built using Microsoft SQL Server, the solution includes an OLTP source database from Azure Cloud, a deployed data warehouse, ETL processes, and a deployed SSAS Tabular Model to demonstrate the solution. Through this process, the school is given the visibility into enrollment trends, class capacities, and student activity, enabling better decision-making, and more effective resource planning. Deliverables include reporting, a star-schema data warehouse, and interactive dashboards developed in Excel. 

**Milestone 1: Data Warehouse Design**:
  - Created Visual Studio solution with Documents and Scripts folders.
  - Deployed OLTP database (StudentEnrollments) on Azure using provided scripts.
  - Designed a data warehouse using a star schema.
  - Developed ERD via Draw.io and a metadata worksheet.
  - Created SQL script to generate the data warehouse locally.

 **Milestone 2: ETL Process**:
  - Developed ETL script to extract and load data into the warehouse.
  - Designed an ETL operations report (ETLProcess.rdl) for logging and validation.

 **Milestone 3: SSAS Tabular Model and Reports**:
  - Created SQL views to support SSAS tabular modeling.
  - Built SSAS Tabular Model in Visual Studio with appropriate relationships and measures.
  - Measures included: EnrollmentDollars and EnrollmentCounts.
  - Constructed Excel-based reports using both warehouse and tabular model data.

 **Key Technologies and Tools**:
  - Microsoft SQL Server (Azure and local installations)
  - Visual Studio and SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)
  - SSAS Tabular Model
  - Excel for BI reporting
  - T-SQL and Draw.io for schema design

## Overall Project
This project focuses on student enrollment insights. It involves designing a star-schema data warehouse, implementing ETL pipelines, and developing an SSAS Tabular Model integrated with Excel-based dashboards. The work enhanced skills in data modeling, cloud integration with Azure SQL, and translating raw data into actionable reporting. It demonstrated the ability to build end-to-end BI solutions that support strategic decision-making and operational planning.

This project showcases the end-to-end design and implementation of a Business Intelligence (BI) solution for a small private education organization, leveraging Microsoft SQL Server technologies. The solution features an OLTP source database, a star-schema data warehouse, robust ETL processes, and a deployed SSAS Tabular Model, culminating in interactive Excel dashboards. Through this process, we demonstrated how structured BI development—from data modeling and architecture planning to ETL scripting and tabular modeling—can transform raw data into meaningful insights. The school benefits from improved visibility into enrollment trends, class capacities, and student activity, enabling better decision-making, more effective resource planning, and a scalable data infrastructure for future growth.
